print(x * 3) # hellowhellowhellow
print(x + y) # hellowyes

# ==, =!, <=, >=, <, <, and, or, not

# ord(x) gives the ASCII value of x so when comparing x < y, the ASCII value is compared

# the conditional operators have lower precedence than airthmatic operators 

# x + 3 > x - 3

# in the example, x + 3 and x - 3 is evaluated first then is compared

# precedence of operators: not, and, or
