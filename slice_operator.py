# The slice operator in Python is used to extract a specific portion of a sequence, such as a string, 
# list, or tuple. It is an operator that allows you to specify a starting and ending point, as well as 
#  a step size, and returns a new sequence that contains only the elements within that range.

x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]
y = [ 'hi', 'hello', 'goodbye', 'sure' ]
z = "hellow"


# sliced = x[start: stop: step] #like range method

# print(x[2: 10: 1])

# print(x[:4]) # stop at index 4 start from 0

# print(x[2:]) # start from index 2 and interate till the end

# x[2: 4:] or x[2: 4] start from index 2 and stop in 4

# reverse
# print(x[:: -1])

# It works with tuple as well
