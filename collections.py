# list and tuples

x = [ 4, True, 'hi' ] # like array which can hold any kind of data

# x is mutuable

# len(x) => give length, x.append('hellow'), x.extend([ 5, 5, 5 ]), x.pop(), x[1], x[0] = 'hellow'

# tuples are similar to list but they are immutable 
# can not be changed once defined

x = (0, 1, 2, 2 )

x.append(3) # can't do because of it immutablility features
